## Use Case:

Explain how this feature would be used and who would benefit from it.

## Acceptance Criteria:

### Example:

* Users can upload a profile photo in the account settings or profile page.
* The photo upload process supports common image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
* The maximum allowed file size for the profile photo is 2MB.
* Upon successful upload, the user's profile photo is displayed on their profile page and in other relevant parts of the application.
* The system automatically resizes and crops the uploaded image to fit the designated profile photo dimensions (e.g., 150x150 pixels).
* Users receive a clear error message if they attempt to upload an unsupported file format or a photo larger than 5MB.
* The system retains the original image's aspect ratio when resizing and cropping to prevent distortion.
* Uploaded profile photos are cached for efficient delivery to users, ensuring quick page loading.
* If the user chooses to delete their profile photo, the system removes it from their profile and displays a default placeholder image.
* The uploaded photos are stored securely, and only authorized users can access and modify their profile photo.
